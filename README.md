# Fall Detection using Machine Learning

## Dataset
This project was done using the FallAllD dataset, acquired via this link: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/bnya-mn34.

## Description
The goal of this project is to train and test three machine learning models (kNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) on fall detection using three different sensor placements. The test result would then be compared to find the best position for the sensors during fall detection.

## Files
The repository contains python notebooks for the data exploration and the data preprocessing. There is a python file for each machine learning models, and the test results are saved in a .csv file. Lastly it also contains a python notebook for the visualization of the test results.
